# Kelp MVP

## Project Vision
Kelp empowers individuals and small businesses to create their own customizable, private small language models (SLMs) trained on their own data ‚Äî fully owned, fully controlled, and deployed across web or mobile.

## MVP Scope
- Supported Upload Formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV
- Private Memory Storage using ChromaDB
- Smart File Type Detection
- Simple Chunking System for memory management

## Future MVP Expansion

The current MVP focuses on text-based document processing (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV).

Future MVP expansions are planned to include:
- Support for additional data types: `.json`, `.xlsx`, `.html`, and others
- Image processing and generation capabilities
- Voice (audio) processing: understanding and generating speech
- Video understanding and retrieval
- Code understanding and generation

These additional modalities will gradually evolve Kelp from a private text-based AI memory into a true multimodal private intelligence system.


## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Install required libraries:
pip install streamlit fastapi chromadb llama-index pypdf python-docx pandas duckduckgo-sear

## Code Organization

- `backend.py` ‚Üí Handles document upload, smart file reading, text chunking, and saving memories into ChromaDB.
- `README.md` ‚Üí Project documentation, test logs, future feature ideas.

## üõ°Ô∏è Strategic Design Decision (April 21, 2025)

To preserve Kelp's core philosophy ‚Äî of user control, private intelligence, and flexible quality vs privacy trade-offs ‚Äî we have added a critical strategic layer to Kelp's architecture:

**Kelp Answering System Design:**

After memory search, users can choose how Kelp should generate the final answer:
1. **Strict Memory Only:** Answer strictly based on the uploaded documents. No external augmentation. Preserves highest integrity and privacy. (May have lower reasoning quality.)
2. **Memory + Internet Augmentation:** Fetch supplementary knowledge from the web when necessary, combine it with private memory.
3. **Memory + GPT Reasoning:** Use OpenAI GPT models for high-quality reasoning, accepting that the reasoning brain is a generalist trained on large datasets.

**Principle:**  
Kelp never forces a brain onto the user. Kelp lets the user choose how intelligent, private, or augmented their AI should be.

‚úÖ This ensures maximum user trust, flexibility, and technological realism as Kelp grows from MVP to Beta to 1.0.

Kelp lets you choose between Intelligence vs Individuality

## üîÑ Update: MVP Strategy Shift

We have shifted our MVP strategy from running local SLM models (like Phi 1.5) to **simulating Kelp's SLM (KBase) and LLM (Kawl) using OpenAI GPT-4-turbo APIs** for faster, higher-quality, and scalable MVP delivery.  
This ensures we can showcase stunning answer quality, rich contextual reasoning, and full product flows before migrating to fully local models later.

---

## üß™ Test Log

### ‚úÖ Backend (kelpbrain_server.py) Updated and Working
- Rewrote `/query/` endpoint to support two reasoning modes:
  - **KBase** (Base private memory-based answer)
  - **Kawl** (Enhanced deep reasoning answer)
- Upgraded to use `openai>=1.0.0` client format (`OpenAI()` client instead of `openai.ChatCompletion.create`).
- Added support for structured prompt chaining for KBase ‚ûî Kawl.
- Introduced temporary mock memory retriever (`search_memory_for_relevant_chunks`) to simulate knowledge base retrieval.
- Passed OpenAI API key securely via client initialization.

### ‚úÖ Backend Testing Completed
- Launched FastAPI server successfully on `localhost:8000`.
- Created simple Python test script (`test_query.py`) to POST to `/query/` endpoint.
- Tested both reasoning modes:
  - **KBase Test:**  
    - **Prompt:** "Where was Kelp founded?"
    - **Result:** "Kelp was founded in New York City." ‚úÖ
  - **Kawl Test:**  
    - **Prompt:** "Where was Kelp founded?"
    - **Result:**  
      A rich, detailed, contextual elaboration about New York City‚Äôs startup ecosystem and strategic advantages. ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Result
- KelpBrain now properly thinks through two modes (KBase and Kawl).
- Reasoning quality matches MVP goals for impressing investors and users.
- Backend officially **ready to connect with frontend (Streamlit app.py)**.
