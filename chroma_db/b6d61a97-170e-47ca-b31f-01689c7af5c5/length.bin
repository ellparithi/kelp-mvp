Blue Sky Operations (before the incident)

Preparation for Crisis

In anticipation of potential crises, including the possibility of armed conflict, Foodex implemented robust Blue Sky Operations to ensure readiness and resilience. This included conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities in operations, supply chains, and infrastructure. The Crisis Management Team established detailed emergency response plans, conducted regular tabletop exercises, and trained staff across all departments on evacuation protocols, safety measures, and continuity of operations. Alternate facilities and logistics hubs were identified and prepared, ensuring that essential services could continue even during disruptions. Additionally, Foodex invested in redundant communication systems such as satellite phones and emergency notification platforms to maintain real-time connectivity. By fostering partnerships with local law enforcement, emergency responders, and government agencies, Foodex established clear communication and coordination pathways for rapid response. These proactive measures laid the groundwork for effective decision-making, minimized operational disruption, and prioritized employee safety in the face of an unforeseen crisis.

Basis

The most critical work to ensure business continuity is accomplished before there is a need for it.

The Crisis Management Department at Foodex works with all departments and across all regions to build enterprise resilience through a continual process of hazard identification, capacity-building, planning, exercising, and training.



Planning (Crisis Management Program) 

The foundation of blue sky planning for business continuity is the Crisis Management Program. Its mission is to improve outcomes during crises and shorten timelines to restoration by:

Empowering business unit owners to take action during the disruption of essential services.

Equipping managers and staff with operational tools and skills to act effectively in a crisis.

Enhancing organizational readiness to mitigate risks and manage business continuity proactively.



The specific objectives of the Crisis Management Program include the following:

Train frontline workers, such as drivers and delivery staff, on crisis management workflows and evacuation protocols.

Ensure accountability for critical services by assigning clear roles to department leads and managers.

Provide tools, such as emergency communication apps and satellite phones, to enable quick and effective action in crises.

Identify opportunities for resilience improvement through regular risk assessments at the department and regional levels.



Program components are designed to take a comprehensive approach by connecting to all levels of Foodex: 

Policy Level (Leadership): Senior leadership conducts executive tabletop exercises and integrates resilience into decision-making workflows.

Operations Level (Departments): Department leaders use continuity dashboards and test action plans through drills and simulated disruptions.

Frontline Workers (Employees): Frontline staff participate in periodic training and mock drills to prepare for immediate responses, such as safe evacuation and maintaining critical services.

Readiness (5 Step Incident Management Process) 

The Crisis Management Department applies the processes of the National Incident Management System, or NIMS, to maintain a proactive readiness posture that is the key to maintaining critical services.

The incident management process includes the three critical steps as shown in Table 2 above: 

	Notify key stakeholders with a description of the War threat, what it means, what staff should be doing now and when they should expect more information. 

Personnel notified include on-site personnel (via public address announcement), Administration, Security and Facilities Management.

Notification methods include overhead public address system, phone, mass notification (Foodex Alert!), hotline and UHF radio 

	Activate Escalate emergency operations through a series of transitions, from meetings to a situation room to an CMOC to multiple CMOCs

	Operate Begin response operations, providing situational awareness, surfacing obstacles and unmet needs



Objectives 

Emergency operations has three objectives in the initial minutes and hours of the response:

Manage consequences– identify and solve issues and problems arising from the war threat

Manage information – Ensure the right information in the right form to the right stakeholders

Manage resources – Deploy the right resources - transportation, shelter supplies, IT systems, and personnel—where they are most needed, prioritizing critical operations.

















Process

The ICS Process at Foodex consists of the following steps:

 Executive Leadership Sets Strategic Objectives

Executive Leadership identifies and prioritizes the enterprise-level, or strategic, objectives for the initial phase of the War incident 

 Foodex War Response Team Will Execute Response Operations 

The Foodex Response Team executes incident-related tasks based on the Executive Leadership’s strategic priorities. For each task, a Project Canvas will be completed and updated to include:

Measurable objectives to track progress, such as the percentage of employees evacuated or operational hubs relocated.

Resource and support requirements, including transportation, shelter facilities, and communication tools.

Timetables for completion, such as a 3-day timeline for evacuation and 1-week target for temporary shelters.

Anticipated unmet needs, such as resource shortages or delays due to conflict-related obstacles.



 Foodex War Response Team Coordinates Across Foodex

The Crisis Management Department ensures coordination by:

Facilitating internal and external communications to align all departments and stakeholders with the Action Plan objectives.

Tracking and reporting progress of evacuation, relocation, and operational continuity efforts.

Identifying and resolving unmet needs or obstacles, such as delays in supply chain logistics or insufficient shelter space.



 Business Units and Task Forces Implement Action Plans 

Business Units and cross-functional task forces will mobilize the personnel, materials, supplies and expertise required to fulfill Incident Objectives and continue to:

Report progress metrics

Determine resource and support requirements

Update timetables for completion

Anticipate unmet needs and obstacles 

Manage space and transfer employee functions as needed 

Restoration and transition back to normal operations

 Foodex War Response Team Provides Situational Awareness 

The War Response Team provides situational awareness through ICS Briefings and Situation Reports including detailed description of incident, timing, severity and anticipated impacts, Current progress on evacuation, service continuity, and communication with stakeholders.

 ICS Process Continues

ICS process continues on an ongoing basis through conclusion of incident and completion of incident objectives. 


Catastrophic Incident Procedure 

The following procedure would be activated in the event of a large-scale and severe incident (the ongoing war scenario) with widespread and prolonged impacts to our human resources, critical services and physical resources



 Determine who is in charge (Succession)

In the event of a loss or unavailability of key leadership staff would be directed to assume specific roles in another’s absence through succession planning and delegations of authority.

Executive leadership and clinical leadership will be elevated to assume additional roles and responsibilities as dictated by the needs of the emergency or disaster.

The Board of Trustees has authority to appoint replacements for any position, as outlined in the by-laws, if they become incapacitated or otherwise incapable of fulfilling the duties of their position.

Key leadership are listed in priority order immediately below with the understanding that the highest level available individual will be the lead for each Section until and if a higher level individual becomes available from the same Section.   



Crisis Manager: Parithi E

Operations Lead: Taqui Ahmed

Security Lead: Xili Gong



(See Appendix 1 and 1a: Contact Information for Leadership and Executive Leadership Ops for specific contact information)



Delegation of Authority

During an emergency, authority will be delegated in accordance with the existing departmental hierarchy and table of organization as maintained by Human Resources.

Temporary reassignments of staff may be authorized by Executive Leadership as required by the demands of the emergency or disaster.

Under these circumstances, any staff temporarily reassigned to support response activities may be delegated authority beyond their official duties



This process would be replicated across Foodex to:  

Identify and develop internal staff with the potential to fill key business leadership positions in the company. 

Increase the availability of experienced and capable employees that are prepared to assume these roles as they become available.   

Ensure facilities have employees who are capable of assuming various critical roles in the event that current staff and leadership are not available.  

Every facility has a qualified person who is authorized to act in the absence of the administrator or person legally responsible for the operations of the facility



 Determine Where to Operate From (Alternate Facilities)

Based on the catastrophic event available operational facilities and Enterprise operational prioritizes will drive the selection of alternate facilities.  

Established operating facilities (CMOCs in present facilities)

Available Facilities identified as alternatives within Foodex] 

Available pre-identified non-Foodex facilities within Manhattan and within close proximity to Enterprise facilities

Other pre-identified facilities within San Francisco

Other pre-identified facilities within California

Ad hoc facilities identified post-incident

(See Appendix 2a and 2b: Continuity of Operations Facilities to identify alternate locations)







 Determine capability and alternatives to communicate (Continuity Communications) 

Assess available emergency communications equipment and systems available to leadership including pre-distributed equipment and stored emergency communication equipment.  Determine the use and/or distribution of communications equipment with an understanding of the following: 

General communications (landline and cells) capability 

External public safety emergency communications modes, if available

IT systems should be considered inoperable and data sharing unavailable

Satellite and hand radios are primary alternative 

Alternate facility communications capability may be impacted

(See Appendix 3: Communications to identify available COMS alternatives and equipment)








Emergency Communications 

This emergency preparedness communication plan complies with Federal, State, and local laws and is reviewed and updated annually
