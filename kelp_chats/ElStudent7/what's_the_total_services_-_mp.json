Focus on Local Businesses and Creators: Based on the name \"Locally\", it seems this platform is focused on supporting local businesses, artisans, and creators, rather than the broader e-commerce approach of Etsy and Shopify. This could allow Locally to better cater to the needs of hyper-local communities and provide more personalized services.\n\n2. Creator Collaboration Services: The data shows Locally offers various \"Creator Collaboration\" services, including for creators, influencers, and brand partnerships. This suggests Locally may provide more hands-on support and facilitation of collaborations between local creators and brands, which could be a key differentiator from more general marketplaces.\n\n3. Emphasis on Production and Logistics: The detailed cost breakdowns for production crew, supplies, transportation, and other project-related expenses indicate Locally may offer more comprehensive production and logistics services compared to competitors. This could appeal to businesses and creators who need end-to-end support for their online sales and marketing efforts.\n\n4. Localized Marketing and Advertising: While the data does not provide specifics, the high costs for advertising and marketing suggest Locally may invest heavily in targeted, localized marketing campaigns to drive awareness and sales for its local business customers.\n\nWithout more context about Locally's actual positioning and offerings, these are just some potential areas of differentiation based on the available financial data. Further research would be needed to fully understand how Locally positions itself against Etsy, Shopify, and other e-commerce platforms."], ["user", "What are the key features of the Locally app?"], ["kelp", "I apologize, but the provided information does not contain details about the key features of the Locally app. The data appears to be financial statements and transaction details, which do not directly address the features of the Locally app.\n\nWithout more context about the Locally app, I'm unable to provide a comprehensive overview of its key features.
